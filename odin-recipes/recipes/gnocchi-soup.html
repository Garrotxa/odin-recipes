    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a soup my dad taught me to make. It's one of the first proper dishes I learned to cook for my family. The soup is made with chicken stock as the base. Added to it are various vegetables, spices, and meats. For my personal recipe, I use the ingredients listed below, but feel free to substitute as desired.</p>
    <p>This soup is a healthy, delicious, easy-to-cook crowd-pleaser. It tastes great re-heated, and I love to make a large pot of it to eat multiple times in a week.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Two cartons of <strong>chicken stock</strong></li>
    <li>One pound of <strong>chicken</strong>, pan-fried and cut into chucnks.</li>
    <li>One large <strong>onion</strong>, diced.</li>
    <li>One <strong>shallot</strong>, diced.</li>
    <li>Fifteen <strong>carrots</strong>, </li>

</ul>
